					<div class="detail-sm-item">
						<h5>" I want to dress my kids in the latest fashion, but they grow up so fast and it takes too much money. "</h5> <br>
						<p>It is always pleasant for all the parents to put their children in an adorable and stylish clothing. As the influence of social networking services gets bigger and bigger in our lives, the user needs for better kids clothes have remarkably increased. However, spending too much money on children’s clothing isn’t efficient because they grow up so fast and kids clothes made by famous brand are too expensive.

			<div class="detail-item">
				<h4 class="detail-title">Solution.</h4>
					<div class="detail-sm-item">
						<p>We devised a web application that offers stylish and budget-friendly kids clothing choice for parents who want to dress children fashionably and become a thrifty shopper at the same time. Momice helps parents make a better choice by giving users a personalized recommendation based on their kids’ body measurement information and tastes. In addition, it offers a subscription service which delivers clothes once a week, so that parents don’t need to worry about cleaning or buying newer clothes.
